Privacy Policy for RecordMe
Introduction
RecordMe ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the RecordMe mobile application ("the App") handles your data. In short, we do not collect, share, or transmit any personal user data to the developer or to third parties. We only use your device’s microphone and location data for the App’s core functionality, as detailed below.
Data Collection and Sharing
No Personal Data Collected: RecordMe does not collect any personal information or identifiable user data. We do not require you to provide your name, email, contact details, or any other personal details to use the App. We do not collect usage analytics or any background data about your device. All information you create or manage within the App remains on your device. No Data Shared or Transmitted: Because we do not collect any user data, we also do not share any data with anyone. The App will never send your recordings, location information, or any other app data to our servers (we have no servers for this App) or to any third-party services. In other words, nothing you do in RecordMe is uploaded or transmitted off your device.
Device Permissions and Their Use
RecordMe requires certain device permissions solely to provide its core features. These permissions are used only for their intended functionality and not for any other purpose:
Microphone Access: Used only to record audio, as this is the main function of the App. The audio you record is stored locally on your device. We do not listen to, collect, or send these recordings anywhere outside your device.
Location (GPS) Access: Used only if you choose to utilize location-based features in the App (for example, tagging an audio recording with the location where it was made). This permission allows the App to access your device’s GPS coordinates strictly for providing in-app functionality. Any location data obtained (such as GPS coordinates of a recording) is stored locally with your recordings and is not transmitted to us or any third party. If you prefer not to use location features, you can deny the location permission and the App will still function (minus location tagging).
Please note: Granting these permissions is optional, but certain features (like audio recording or location tagging) will not work without the corresponding permission. Regardless of whether you grant these permissions, no data from these sensors is ever sent off your device by RecordMe.
Local Data Storage Only
All data created by or used in RecordMe is stored locally on your device. This includes your audio recordings and any associated GPS location tags or coordinates. The data remains under your control on your device’s storage. We (RecordMe) have no access to this data and do not copy or upload it to any server or cloud service. Because the App does not use cloud backup or online storage, your recordings and data stay private to you. If you choose to share an audio file or information with someone (for example, by manually sending a recording file to a friend), that action is initiated by you outside the App’s automatic processes. RecordMe itself never automatically sends your data anywhere.
No Analytics, Advertising, or Third-Party Services
RecordMe does not utilize any third-party analytics frameworks, advertising networks, or social media plugins. We do not use Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or any similar service in this App. We also do not display ads, and therefore no advertising SDKs are integrated that could track you. This means the App isn’t collecting usage statistics or tracking your behavior for any marketing or data-mining purposes. Your usage of RecordMe is private and not monitored by us or by third parties. Additionally, RecordMe does not integrate with any cloud services or external databases. There are no in-app trackers, and no personal or sensitive information leaves your device. By avoiding analytics and third-party services, we ensure that your data (including how you use the App) stays with you and is not shared or monetized by anyone.
Children’s Privacy
This App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since RecordMe does not collect any user data, it likewise does not collect data from children. If you are under 13, please do not use RecordMe. Parents and guardians should be aware that the App is not designed for use by young children.
